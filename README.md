# ImageProcessing

## Overview

This project uses machine learning and image processing techniques to cluster similar faces from the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction.

## Features

- Explore LFW dataset images.
- Apply PCA to images.
- Cluster images using k-means and k-medoids.
- Evaluate clustering performance.
